# FAQ

## Why are the line number not showing?

If you have properly followed the [quick start guide](quickstart.md) and double-checked that the _Show line numbering_ checkbox is checked in your document. Then try to reload the Google Docs documents, restart your browser and check that the extension is enabled by going to _chrome://extensions/_ in the URL bar.

If you still can't see the line numbers on your document please [reach out](https://linenumbers.app/contact) for help.

## Not all line numbers show up when printing or saving to PDF, why?

This issue may arise when to entire document was not properly loaded. Try scrolling through the entire document before printing or exporting the document to a PDF.

Make sure you follow the instruction found in the [Exporting Line Numbers](export.md) section.

## Why must I sign in with Google to use the extension?

Signing in with Google allows us to properly keep track of and secure your line numbering settings. Document settings are associated to a single user and only that user has immediate access to edit those line numbering settings. This means your line numbering settings will immediatly be accessible on any device the extension is installed on. 

Other users with whom the document is shared may also want to edit these settings. Being signed in with Google simplifies the authentication and permission handling of the line numbering settings. In the case that the user is not the owner of the line numbering settings, the user will be asked to give permission to the extension to access the document to check if the user has write permissions to the document and if so will be allowed to modify the line numbering settings. This means you can share your document with other users and they will also have and be able to modify the same numbering settings when editing the document if they also have the extension installed.

## Can students and academics get a premium subscription for free?

## Why is it slow?

If your document is very big then Google Docs starts slowing down substantially â€” this is a known problem to Google. So the performance problems you are experiencing may have nothing to do with the extension itself.

You should try disabling the extension by going to _chrome://extensions/_ in the URL bar. Then reload your document and check if the performance problems are still apparent. If you notice an increase in performance please [contact me](https://linenumbers.app/contact) so that I can look into it.
